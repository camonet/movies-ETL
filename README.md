# movies-ETL
### The purpose of this analysis was to create an automated pipeline that performs the ETL process completed for movie company "Amazing Prime". Code was  refactored to create a function that extracts in Wikipedia data, Kaggle metadata, and MovieLens rating data, transforms the data, then loads the data into an SQL database.
